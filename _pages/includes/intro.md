I am the 2nd-year Ph.D. student in the college of [Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/) at 
[Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/), fortunately advised by Prof. [Yang Yang](http://yangy.org/).
I completed my undergraduate studies at the [ZJU-UIUC Institute](https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/), majoring in Computer Engineering (CompE), and earned dual Bachelor's degrees in Engineering from Zhejiang University and [The Grainger College of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://grainger.illinois.edu/). In 2022, I participated in an exchange program at UIUC.
My research interests include neural signal decoding, large-scale models for EEG signals, machine learning for healthcare, and human-centered AI.
