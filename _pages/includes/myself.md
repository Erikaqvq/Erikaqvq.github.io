**Room78**

I founded Room78 Algorithm Club as one of the co-founders in 2020 at Haining Campus, ZJU. Until Septem 2022, I served as the president of Room78. We have own open judge, which is used for daily teaching and practice, as well as for small simulation competitions. Room78 holds workshops on research and competition experience sharing, as well as algorithm lectures like "Our Life Dominated by Algorithms" for all students in Haining campus.
